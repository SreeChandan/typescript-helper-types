# typescript-helper-types
Some collection of typescript types I curate/create , test and maintain. Not a library. If you need them you copy paste them.

* typeHelpers
  * test.ts      `// testing for types developed in types.ts`
  * testsBase.ts `// some helper functions to help testing`
  * types.ts     `// types being developed`
